============

 * The URL should have been the root url (i.e. 127.0.0.1:8000/). In the future, please at least make a route for the empty URL.
  * Thanks for putting the entry URL in your README though!

 * Crashes when trying to divide by 0, for a functioning calculator, don't forget to account for this edge case.

 * When an operator is input, the text field displays 0, which is not something a calculator normally displays.
