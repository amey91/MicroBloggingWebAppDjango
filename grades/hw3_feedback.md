HW3 Feedback
============

#### Registration/Email

 * User should access registration page without logging in. (-2)
 * No registration email (-6)

#### HW2 Details

  * Logout is not deleting a session. Able to access all pages after logout. (-4)

#### Grumbls (Commenting/Dislikes)

 * Displaying last few comments for grumbles is a good enhancement. Display number of comments as well.

#### Images

 * Image uploading for profiles not implemented (-8)

#### User Relations (Following/Blocking)

 * Blocked user’s grumbls show up in search results (-2)
 * Display grumbls after disliking them. I am getting redirected to irrelevant page.
 * No page to see grumbls of users that we are following. (-4)

#### Django & General 
 
 * Did not use Django forms (-8)
 * You should display Edit profile link only for logged in user profile. All other profiles also have a link for editing profile.
 * Remove unnecessary navigation links like "temp".
 * Navigation bar should not display menu items which require logging in prior to user authentication.

#### Overall

 * Site looks good but there are lot of required features missing or implemented partially. Make sure to meet the requirements before submitting the homework.
