I have creaated a few users with password set their usernames for all of them. They are:

amey
charlie
ram12
jason8
sai67
meh999
cool_lulz

eg. amey has password amey
while meh999 has password meh999


There was ambiguity regarding bloccking. My implementation states that the blocked person can see the the grumbls of the one who blocked. But the one who blocked will not see the grumbls of whom he blocked anywhere.

I used Charlie's class example for ajax and emails.
