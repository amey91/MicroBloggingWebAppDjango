I have creaated a few users with password set their usernames for all of them. They are:

amey
sairam
charlie12
ram2013
jason

eg. amey has password amey
while ram2013 has password ram2013


There was ambiguity regarding blocking. My implementation states that the blocked person can see the the grumbls of the one who blocked. But the one who blocked will not see the grumbls of whom he blocked anywhere.

I used Charlie's class example for ajax and emails.

AJAX is implemented on the "comment_on_grumblr" page.
To access this page, simply comment on any grumblr or click on "comment" button for any grumblr. You will be redirected to the adding comment page where I have given an option for adding comments by both POST and AJAX call(via button push). User data is validated for blank entries. This page automatically refreshes every 10 seconds to include any new commments on that particular grumbl.
